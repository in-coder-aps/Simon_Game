# Simon_Game
The Simon Game is a classic memory game that challenges players to remember a growing sequence of lights and sounds. This project is a web-based implementation of the Simon Game, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Test and enhance your memory skills by trying to replicate the ever-increasing pattern!

## How to Play?
1.Begin the fun by simply pressing any key on your keyboard. The game will kick off with a cheerful beat!
2.You'll find yourself at Level 1, where one of the four vibrant colors will light up and produce a delightful sound. Pay close attention, and click on that button.
3.Now, you are at level 2 and repeat the same process to increase the level.
4.At any arbitrary level x, you have to press all the buttons in the same order from level-1 to increase your level by 1.
